# SvelteKit on the edge with Edge Config

A demo [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) app running on [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions), which reads values from an Edge Config. This app runs close to your users to enable dynamic server-side rendering at the speed of static content.

This demo is based on the [sveltekit-on-the-edge](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sveltekit-on-the-edge) example, but extended to also read Edge Config.

## How to enable edge functions in your SvelteKit app deployed to Vercel

- Use your package manager to install [`@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-vercel)
- Update [svelte.config.js](/svelte.config.js) to use `adapter-vercel` instead of the default `adapter-auto`
- Pass the `edge: true` option to the adapter

## How to enable Edge Config locally

- Create an Edge Config in your account on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
- Create a token for your Edge Config
- On the page listing your Edge Config's tokens click on the â‹® button and then on "Copy Connection String"
- Create a `.env` file and declare an environment variable called `EDGE_CONFIG` containing the connection string

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Deploying

The easiest way to deploy your app is to link the repo to your Vercel account. Alternatively, you can create a production build locally...

```
npm run build
```

...and deploy the prebuilt app to Vercel:

```
vc deploy --prebuilt
```
